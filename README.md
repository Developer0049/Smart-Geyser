# Smart-Geyser
This project uses Arduino and ESP32 to control the temperature of a geyser and automatically turn on or off the power supply.

Components Required:
-> NodeMCU ESP8266 board
-> LCD Display 16x2
-> I2C interface for LCD
-> DS18B20 Temperature Sensor
-> 2 x Push Buttons
-> Relay Module (1-channel)
-> Breadboard or PCB for prototyping
-> Jumper wires for connections
-> 1 x resistor for DS18B20 Temperature Sensor
-> Water Heater Coil

We will also use BLYNK app to control the temperature of water.
